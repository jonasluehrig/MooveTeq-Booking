# ScooTeq-Booking

This software is part of our apprenticeship during one of the school lesson blocks at the ITECH-BS14.
It's a functional mockup of a scooter booking application for an imaginary company, based on C# and utilizing the EntityFramework with SQLite as database backend, Google Maps for distance calculation and WinForms for the GUI.
Features include things like user management and registration, two choices what to book a scooter by (time+money that counts up, or a fixed distance that counts down) and a straight forward UI with a relatively clean look (when taking into consideration that neither of us is any good with UI design!)
